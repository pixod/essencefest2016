Nubian Love: Inverse curve
<BR>Truely Supreme and Sacred Mathematics
<BR><BR>

The green cardioid is obtained by inverting the red parabola across the dashed circle.
The cardioid is one possible inverse curve for a parabola. Specifically, if a parabola is inverted across any circle whose center lies at the focus of the parabola, the result is a cardioid. The cusp of the resulting cardioid will lie at the center of the circle, and corresponds to the vanishing point of the parabola.
In terms of stereographic projection, this says that a parabola in the Euclidean plane is the projection of a cardioid drawn on the sphere whose cusp is at the north pole.
Not every inverse curve of a parabola is a cardioid. For example, if a parabola is inverted across a circle whose center lies at the vertex of the parabola, then the result is a cissoid of Diocles.
The picture to the right shows the parabola with polar equation

In Cartesian coordinates, this is the parabola y2 = 2x + 1. When this parabola is inverted across the unit circle, the result is a cardioid with the reciprocal equation
